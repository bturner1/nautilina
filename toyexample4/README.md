A provider is the one with data, computing power or both that wants to offer it on Ocean. 
Toy example 4) "Schooner" (_A schooner /ˈskuːnər/ is a type of sailing vessel with fore-and-aft sails on two or more masts, and was popular for some trading routes in Pacific!_) - let's put some precious cargo/data (without computing instance) on Ocean and let it float.

Try using [Pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston) and publish an asset! Don't forget that you do have to host your data and that Ocean serves as a marketplace:
